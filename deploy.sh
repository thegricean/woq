## This script aims to automate these steps:
# 1. Copy everything in `experiment` folder into `public` folder
# 2. Copy the `_shared` folder, which was originally at root level, into `public`  folder
# 3. Change the name of `norming.html` to `index.html`
# 4. Change all the references to `../../_shared` to `_shared`
# 5. The page should be rebuilt at each push, or at each manual launch of the CI task on Gitlab
